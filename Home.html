<p>2-phase algorithm for the open capacitated vehicle routing problem.<br>
<br>
It takes the geographic coordinates of a depot and the locations clients with orders to be delivered by a fleet of trucks.
<br>
<br>
The class uses a 2-phase algorithm for solving the open capacitated vehicle routing problem.<br>
<br>
